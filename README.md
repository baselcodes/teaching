#This contains all the stuff related to teaching

## guideline

All our teaching project should be enclosed into folders: `class`, `workshop` or `talk`

the folder should be named in this way `YYYYMM[type]_[title_with_underscore]@[institution_name]_[internal_institute_name]`

like this

 `201903WS_copy_it_right@HGK_masterstudio`

the `[type]` defines whether it is a worksop `WS`, a class `CL` or a talk `TK`

you can populated the folder with whatever you like!
